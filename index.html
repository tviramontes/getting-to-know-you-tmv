<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue">Introduction</h2> 
Hello all! I am a physics major with a math minor. After Lewis, I plan on attending graduate school,potentially at Lewis, to acquire a masters degree in data science. Currently, I volunteer to coach an in house baseball team in Joliet, and within the next few weeks I will also be coaching a 9U travel baseball team as well. I have three younger brothers, one of which is on the team that I coach. The one of other two are in high school and while the other is studying Civil engineering at UIUC. I got two puppies this past spring which have also taken up quite a bit of my time. 

<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue">What I Hope to Learn in This Course</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
<li> Computing Components and File Systems 
<li> Programming in python, specifically for solving computational problems in regards to physics and mathematical modeling. 
<li> The topic of Artificial intelligence also seems very intriguing.
</ul>

<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue">My Favorite Hobbies</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
<li> Coaching Baseball
<li> Going to sporting events, such as baseball and football games
<li> Spending time with family
<li> Swimming in the summer
<li> Taking my dogs for walks
</ul>

I have been to 8 of the 30 professional baseball stadiums, and hope to visit all of them at some point in my life. A few of my favorites were Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Yankee Stadium.
